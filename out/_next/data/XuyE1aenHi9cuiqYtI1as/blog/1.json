These events had well over 100 people.\n\nOmicron is now circulating in Auckland and possibly the Nelson area, if not further, Ardern said.\n\nThe Government will be taking a three-stage approach to the point where New Zealand sees 1000 cases a day, Ardern said.\n\nStage one will be the familiar stamp it out approach, with contact tracing and testing, including rapid antigen tests. Stage two will be a transition stage. The third stage will see changes to contact tracing, and further details on the three stages will be released at a later date, Ardern said."}},"__N_SSG":true}
