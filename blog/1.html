Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has confirmed New Zealand will move to the red traffic light setting at midnight tonight.

Nine Covid cases in Motueka are confirmed to have the Omicron variant, prompting the decision, Ardern said.

They attended a wedding in Auckland on January 13 along with a funeral, an amusement park and the Sky Tower in the following days. These events had well over 100 people.

Omicron is now circulating in Auckland and possibly the Nelson area, if not further, Ardern said.

The Government will be taking a three-stage approach to the point where New Zealand sees 1000 cases a day, Ardern said.

Stage one will be the familiar stamp it out approach, with contact tracing and testing, including rapid antigen tests. Stage two will be a transition stage. The third stage will see changes to contact tracing, and further details on the three stages will be released at a later date, Ardern said.</p></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"blogId":1,"blogTitle":"Blog Title New","blogBody":"New Zealand moves to red\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern has confirmed New Zealand will move to the red traffic light setting at midnight tonight.\n\nNine Covid cases in Motueka are confirmed to have the Omicron variant, prompting the decision, Ardern said.\n\nThey attended a wedding in Auckland on January 13 along with a funeral, an amusement park and the Sky Tower in the following days.
