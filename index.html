Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has confirmed New Zealand will move to the red traffic light setting at midnight tonight.

Nine Covid cases in Motueka are confirmed to have the Omicron variant, prompting the decision, Ardern said.

They attended a wedding in Auckland on January 13 along with a funeral, an amusement park and the Sky Tower in the following days. These events had well over 100 people.

Omicron is now circulating in Auckland and possibly the Nelson area, if not further, Ardern said.

The Government will be taking a three-stage approach to the point where New Zealand sees 1000 cases a day, Ardern said.

Stage one will be the familiar stamp it out approach, with contact tracing and testing, including rapid antigen tests. Stage two will be a transition stage. The third stage will see changes to contact tracing, and further details on the three stages will be released at a later date, Ardern said.</p></div><div style="color:red;margin-left:30px;width:60%"><a href="/blog/2"><h1>Blog Title Two</h1></a><p style="color:gray">New locations of interest linked to the Omicron outbreak have been revealed by the Ministry of Health - including Auckland Airport&#x27;s domestic terminal.

Rest home Summerset by the Park in Flat Bush is also a new location of interest.

Those at the airport terminal on Sunday January 16 from 4.15-5pm are asked to self-isolate, test immediately and on day 5 after you were exposed at this location of interest. Further isolation and testing requirements will be provided by public health officials.

Those linked to the rest home who were there at the following times are being asked to self-monitor for Covid-19 symptoms for 10 days after you were exposed. If symptoms develop, get a test and stay at home until you get a negative test result.
